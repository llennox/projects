1) wallet on server

2) wallet on my ext 

two wallets, one offline on my ext hard drive 20% of all bits sent to wallet 1 are sent here. 

wallet two generates public addresses with bip32 pycoin, puts them in database, assigns them to users, when a transaction comes in it finds user associated with that address and credits their account. when user withdrawals number of credits are converted to btc wallet 2 sends transaction, if it's over 100$~ wait for my confirmation maybe send email.
